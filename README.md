# Mass Shootings
The code chunks were designed for my Applied Statistics class and examined mass schooting data to debunk myths that are thought to be common knowledge.

Using the mass shootings dataset it was important to first define what a mass shooting was, what variables can actually be measured and what can be done with the data that is present. Based on previous knowledge of school shootings, this can help make predictions in what can be seen in the data to focus on certain years of high profile mass shootings throughout the analysis. 

In this repository there is data subsetting, regression models based on predicting variables, representations of the distribution, an ANOVA to determine significance, a step function for variable selection, and tukey model to see where significance lies with number of weapons.
